AIM:
To Interfacing an MQ-2 Gas Sensor with an LED
Procedure:
 Step-1: Connect the MQ-2 gas sensor to the microcontroller (VCC, GND, and signal pin to
ADC).
Step-2: Assign the signal pin and an LED pin in the program.
Step-3: Initialize the signal pin as input and the LED pin as output.
Step-4: Write the code to read gas levels and control the LED based on a threshold.
Step-5: Upload and execute the program.
Step-6: Test with gas exposure and observe LED behavior.
Program:
int redLed = 12;
int greenLed = 11;
int buzzer = 10;
int smokeA0 = A5;
// Your threshold value
int sensorThres = 250;
void setup() {
pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);
pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);
pinMode(smokeA0, INPUT);
Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
int analogSensor = analogRead(smokeA0);
Serial.print("Pin A0: ");
Serial.println(analogSensor);
// Checks if it has reached the threshold value
if (analogSensor > sensorThres)
{
digitalWrite(redLed, HIGH);
digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
tone(buzzer, 1000, 200);
}
else
{
digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH);
noTone(buzzer);
}
delay(100);
}
Connections:
 MQ-2 Gas Sensor:
VCC → 5V
GND → GND
AOUT → A5
Red LED:
Anode → Pin 12 (via 220Ω resistor)
Cathode → GND
 Green LED:
 Anode → Pin 11 (via 220Ω resistor)
 Cathode → GND
Buzzer:
Positive Terminal → Pin 10
Negative Terminal → GND
Output:
Pin A0: 150
Pin A0: 180
Pin A0: 200
Pin A0: 280
Pin A0: 310
Pin A0: 220
LED light blinks

Result:
MQ-2 detects gas levels, turning on an LED when the threshold is surpassed.
