AIM:
To Interfacing UART for LED Control between IoT and PC.
Procedure:
Step-1: Connect the microcontroller (IoT device) to the PC using UART pins (TX, RX, GND).
Step-2: Assign UART communication pins and the LED pin in the program.
Step-3: Initialize UART communication with the correct baud rate (e.g., 9600 bps).
Step-4: Write the code to receive data from the PC and control the LED (e.g., '1' to turn ON, '0' to
turn OFF).
Step-5: Upload and execute the program.
Step-6: Send commands from the PC via a serial terminal and observe the LED's behavior.



Program:
int led = 13;
int value = 0;
void setup() {
 Serial.begin(9600);
 pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
 if (Serial.available() > 0) {
 value = Serial.read();
 delay(5);
 if (value == '1') {
 digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
 Serial.println("LED is ON");
 }
 if (value == '0') {
 digitalWrite(led, LOW);
 Serial.println("LED is OFF");
 }
 }
}
Output:
1
LED is ON
0
LED is OFF


Result:
UART enables communication between IoT and PC to control an LED remotely.
